I was born overseas in the U.K. as a military child, living all over the world throughout adolescence.  I grew up racing motocross and riding freestyle BMX, both of which I competed in at a professional level.  After leaving motocross I got into computers, network security, EE and hacking any device I could get my hands on. Over a decade later I am still learning about and building tech.
