I have been working in technology and web development for the last 11 years. I came from an Electrical Engineering and Network Engineering background before working as a programmer full time. I studied Physics in College while working as a web developer. I have worked in most web technology stacks but my focus lately has been Content Management Systems for businesses, both WordPress and static Website Generators like Jekyll and Hugo with a CMS on top. I focus on functional fast loading websites, with emphasis on load times and optimizing for speed and search engines. My latest interest is studying and building Machine Learning Web Apps.
